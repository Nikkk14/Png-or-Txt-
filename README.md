# Png-or-Txt-
Greetings, TryHackMe community!

I am excited to share with you a unique challenge that will put your steganography skills to the test. In this challenge, you will be working with an image file named HackMe.png. Upon first glance, the image may appear to be a regular PNG file, but there's more than meets the eye.

Hidden within the HackMe.png file is a secret message that can be revealed by opening the image as a text file using a simple text editor like Notepad. To uncover the hidden text, follow these steps:

Step 1) Right-click on the HackMe.png file and select "Open with" from the context menu. 

Step 2) Choose "Notepad" or any other text editor of your choice to open the image as a text file. 

Step 3) Scroll all the way to the last line of the text file, and there you will find the hidden message.

Step 4) We won't spoil the surprise by revealing the contents of the hidden text, but we assure you that it's worth the challenge! Be sure to take your time and thoroughly examine the image file to uncover the hidden message. 

We hope this challenge piques your curiosity and encourages you to explore the world of steganography further. Good luck, and happy hacking!
